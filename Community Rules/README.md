### 12/31/23 – 10:34 AM EST
1. No doxxing or harassment (especially threats on someone’s life/property) or encouraging self-harm.
2. No spamming, phishing, or attempting to steal another user’s account (broadly speaking, one could consider this “no spamming or scamming”).
3. No child porn, revenge porn or gore/animal cruelty anywhere in the server, while other NSFW content should be limited to properly marked channels.
4. No sharing pirated content.
5. Distributing “auto,” “macro,” or “cheat utility” programs as well as providing hacked/modded game software through Discord is prohibited.
6. Discriminatory jokes and language related to one’s race, age, gender, disability, etc. are prohibited.
7. Content that is explicitly pornographic, depicting sexual acts, or depicting nudity is prohibited.
8. Content that includes discussions of nudity, sexuality and violence is considered NSFW content and should occur only in the properly marked channels.
9. Trolling is prohibited.
    * Trolling - Trolling refers to the act of disrupting the chat, making a nuisance out of yourself, deliberately making others uncomfortable, or otherwise attempting to start trouble.
10. Discussing offensive/controversial material is prohibited unless those involved in the discussion agree to speak about it and it is discussed humanely.
    * Offensive/Controversial Material - This includes topics such as politics, religion, acts of violence, rape, suicide/self-harm, school shootings, and other serious topics; as well as hate speech including racial slurs or derivatives thereof, sexist or homophobic statements, ableist slurs, and other similar types of behavior.
11. Elitism is prohibited.
    * Elitism - Members should refrain from insulting or belittling others based on the games or versions of games that they choose to play.
12. Disrespecting server staff is prohibited.
    * Disrespecting Server Staff - Insulting the server moderators or becoming belligerent after being warned.
13. Incitement is prohibited.
    * Incitement - Encouraging the breaking of rules, inciting others to be blatantly rude and offensive, or otherwise promoting and/or encouraging conflicts between other members.
14. Punishment evasion is prohibited.
    * Punishment Evasion - Users should not attempt to evade the consequences of their actions such as using an alternate account to bypass restrictions.
15. Inappropriate user profiles are prohibited.
    * Inappropriate User Profiles - For ease of communication and the comfort of those in chat, the profile picture, custom status, and display names (i.e., the name that shows up while reading the chat) of users should be in line with the rules of the server. Furthermore, the display name should also be easily readable, mentionable, and not attempt to imitate other users or game development staff or hoist you to the top of the server online list.
    * In effect, this also means that the user profile should be safe for work, not contain any offensive or illegal content, and not be used to harass others or spam/scam.
    * “Hoisting” refers to using characters like exclamation points to make it so that you appear at the top of the online members list. Some people will put multiple characters like this in an attempt to be at the top of the online list. While it is not always feasible to enforce against users that don’t often chat, it is good to have a policy to enforce this if you see someone chatting with a hoisted display name. But, if this doesn’t bother you, you can remove this provision.
16. Advertising your personal social media, Discord server(s), or content creation channel(s) is prohibited unless it is approved by the owner, administrator(s), or moderator(s).
    * Advertisement - Similar but not quite the same as spam, this refers to users attempting to promote their own social media/discord servers/other content creation channels.
17. English is the official language of this Discord server and only it should be used in voice and text channels.
    * Speaking languages not understood by the server - Essentially, users should be prohibited from communicating in a language outside of the server’s official language.
18. [Discord's terms of service](https://discord.com/terms) and [Discord's community guidelines](https://discord.com/guidelines) must be followed at all times.
